**[Composer.io](http://composer.io)** is an website that lets you post status updates to many social networks at once.

===

The Composer.io API is becoming a ping.fm drop in replacement.

There are some big parts missing, so we're only supporting about 20% of the functionality,
but for weping for example, yes, it's a drop-in replacement.


The API host is **http://papi.cmp.sr/** (this is an identical number of characters as api.ping.fm,
so you could try to hack binary Ping FM code to work with Composer).

In the future we might have a more modern API at api.cmp.sr.
